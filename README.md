# Personal GoLinks

Inspired by golinks.io, this little Go server and CLI allows you to run a redirect service with a SQLite database.

Add routes by using the `golinks add` command, or alternatively by setting an appropriate secret key and querying with the provided client


Run the `golinks` server with `golinks server`. Set the port to 80 with `golinks server --port 80`
